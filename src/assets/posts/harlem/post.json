      "text": "This 233 unit housing project utilizes a one of a kind facade geometry while also supplying 20% of affordable housing units to the neighborhood of Harlem. One of the challenges was integrating the affordable units into the building to make an inclusive environment for all of the tenants. Another challenge was create a facade system that could fit to the double-curved surface of the facade while also allowing for planar operable windows. The solution was an innovative curtain wall system that using faceting in the solid panels to allow the window planels to be planar. One of my roles was managing this geometry and the interoperability between Grasshopper and Revit."

The solution to this proplem was building a t-shaped, doubled loaded corridor building that warped and cantilevered over the existing building. The six columns that support the cantilevered T portion of the building thread through the existing building without touching or impacting any of the existing structure or mechanical systems."
