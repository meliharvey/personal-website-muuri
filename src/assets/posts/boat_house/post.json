      "text": "The most memorable aspect this lakeside site was a shale cliff hemmed by a thin stony beach. In order to preserve this untouched shoreline, the design attempts to counter the typical building-site relationship as observed in nearby houses. Instead of setting the house into the terrain, it bridges over it. This form allows for both of the required program; 1) an enclosed viewing room set atop a dramatic cliff, and 2) a boat house at the waters edge. This re-conception of the two pavilions as one, also allows for circulation and access down to the shoreline."
