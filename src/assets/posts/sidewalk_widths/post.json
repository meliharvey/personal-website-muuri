Almost overnight, everyone became aware of how sidewalk widths influenced their ability to maintain social distance. As the pandemic progressed, sidewalks would become important sites for street dining, food delivery, socializing, and play. The project sidewalkwidth.nyc sparked a discussion on the use of public space in NYC, and ultimately contributed to the city passing the Open Streets legitlation that converted miles of city streets to pedestrian uses."
