# personal-website-muuri

This the personal website of Meli Harvey. The concept is that there are different classes of posts, but all posts show up as a box which are packed into the main column using a box packing library called [Muuri](https://haltu.github.io/muuri/).

When viewed at a high resolution, the packing looks like a [gallery wall](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/gallery-walls-the-evolving-art-of-nailing-it/2019/05/06/e9c97026-524b-11e9-8d28-f5149e5a2fda_story.html). When viewed on a mobile device, it works as a vertical scroll.
