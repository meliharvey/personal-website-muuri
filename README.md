# personal-website-muuri

This is the personal website of Meli Harvey. The concept is to emulate a [gallery wall](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/gallery-walls-the-evolving-art-of-nailing-it/2019/05/06/e9c97026-524b-11e9-8d28-f5149e5a2fda_story.html), where there are frames of different shapes and colors arranged informally using a box packing algorithm. When viewed on small resolution devices it works as a vertical scroll.
